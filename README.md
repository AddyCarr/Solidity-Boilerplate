# Solidity Project Boilerplate

Solidity Project Boilerplate is a comprehensive template tailored for developing Ethereum smart contracts. This boilerplate streamlines the process of initiating Solidity projects, providing a robust foundation for Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps). It incorporates essential dependencies and configurations to expedite smart contract development.

## Installation

To set up your Solidity project using this boilerplate, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using Yarn.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidity-project-boilerplate.git
cd solidity-project-boilerplate
yarn install
```

## Configuration

Before running your Solidity project, you need to set up a local `.env` file containing sensitive information. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add the following variables:

```plaintext
MNEMONIC="<mnemonic>"
PRIVATE_KEY="<your private key here if you don't have a mnemonic seed>"
INFURA_API_KEY="Infura API"
INFURA_API_SECRET="<Infura API Secret>"
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="<Alchemy API Key>"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="<Etherscan API Key>"
```

- **MNEMONIC**: Your Ethereum wallet mnemonic phrase for local development and testing.
- **PRIVATE_KEY**: Your Ethereum private key if you don't have a mnemonic seed.
- **INFURA_API_KEY**: Your Infura API key for connecting to the Ethereum network.
- **INFURA_API_SECRET**: Your Infura API secret for secure communication with the Ethereum network.
- **ALCHEMY_API_KEY**: Your Alchemy API key for advanced blockchain infrastructure.
- **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Your Etherscan API key for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and never share it publicly, as it contains sensitive information required for interacting with the Ethereum network.
